          Drug Decider helps patients find the right medication by analyzing their symptoms and health conditions.  Drug Decider simulates a patientsâ€™ experience in previous clinical trials, and predicts how a patient would have responded to a number of different medications in those trials.
     
          </p>
          <p>
           To predict how a patient with Schizophrenia would respond to medications, a clinician should first evaluate the patient using the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) which measures the severity of individual symptoms.  Our models first predict how a patient would have responded to a placebo intervention, creating a Placebo Quantified Response Score (PQRS).  The PQRS is that individual patients expected placebo response, which captures general therapeutic effects associated with an intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
          Artifical intelligence models then use the individual PANSS symptoms, the PQRS, and demographic information to predict responses to individual medications using clinical trial records.  These machine learning models simulate how a patient would have performed if they were enrolled in any of these clinical trials, after accounting for the placebo effect.
          </p>
          <p>
          Disclaimer:  Drug Decider technology predicts medication response using statistical models.  Any statistical predictions are meaningless without first being filtered through a licensed medical professional who can evaluate a patient holistically.  Artificial intelligence models are never a substitute for clinical care, and should not be used as such.  Please speak to your doctor if you have any concerns about your prescribed medications.
